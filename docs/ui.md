# UI Usage

The React front-end lives in `ui/` and communicates with the FastAPI backend.
It allows filtering proteins by predicted compartment, renders force plots,
beeswarm and dependence charts, interaction heatmaps, and overlays attributions
on known motifs (PROSITE/Pfam). Start the development server:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm start
```
